Machine Problem 1: Implementing Cache Simulator
- Machine Problem Description:
In this machine problem, a flexible cache and memory hierarchy simulator has been implemented and  the performance, area, and energy of different memory hierarchy configurations were compared, using a subset of the SPEC-2000 benchmark suite. 

- Specification of Memory Hierarchy:  
Designed a generic cache module that can be used at any level in a memory hierarchy. For example, this cache module can be “instantiated” as an L1 cache, an L2 cache, an L3 cache, and so on.
